# UCLA Stats 101C Class Midterm Competition

### Team Limit DNE: Yanhua Lin, Yerin(Hana) Lim, Yingzhen Zhao

## Motivation 
Classification of cancer causing genes 

## Description 
In this project, we will use statistical methods that we have learned in this course to identify both TSGs and OGs. We will use a comprehensive gene feature dataset as our training set. The predictors are various features of the genes. The response under study involves three classes: a gene being OG, TSG or NG. If we can have an accurate prediction of the class of genes, we can use this model to discover new TSGs and OGs, which will be very useful in cancer diagnosis.

Raw dataset contains 3177 genes and 97 predictors. 

## Technologies Used
R 

## Evaluation (Scoring metric) 
Weighted Categorization Accuracy (WCA) 

## Codes
main codes are in the rmd file. 
report is also included in the pdf file. 

## Results 
Our team placed 4th place with the WCA of 0.83380.
